# VERY IMPORTANT

* Change all ShipTransform to BodyTransform (use transform.rebuild and ValkyrienSkies.vsCore.transformFactory)
* Change all shipId mentions to handle nullable logic (if shipId is null or has world id, it's connected to world)
* Redo all VMod constraint logic
* Make new constraint serialization (maybe just use json serialization)

* Remove automatic "Strippable" extension cuz all previous constraints are fucked anyways
* Rename MConstraint to smth else. Maybe "VEntity" or "VmEntity" or smth like that cuz they are not really just a collection of constraints anymore
* Rething saving/loading/creation of constraints. do i really need to save VS constraints? maybe just save only necessary build info and not whole constraints. plus if i do it that way, making MConstraints modifiable will be much easier

# Maybe

* Add an "attachment cleaner" to remove attachments before closing server

# Do Eventually

# Phys rope
* fix incorrect loading

## Rendering
* Add clientside rendering options (like for Rope renderer allow setting maximum number of segments)
* Add clientside validation 
* Add effects for toolgun
* Group rendering objects by types to elevate common operations and add shared data between rendering types
* "Double rendering" so that if the "main" ship is out of rendering distance, it will still render correctly
* Fix rendering when i modify rendering transform of ships and player stands on the ship (VS2 moves camera when player stands on the ship) 
* Redo how normal renderers and block renderers work

## Constraint disabler
* A "wrapper" MConstraint that will "wrap" around MConstraint and enable/disable it when signal is given

## java.awt.Color doesn't exist in headless mode

## Toolgun settings presets menu
* maybe when pressing alt or smth it will show all presets for this mode, and allow player to cycle them

## Add a "wire" thing maybe as an addon to vmod

## General Code Structure
* Create "AutoGUIBuilder"

## Ticking Constraints
* Redo them

## HUD Rendering
* Add info window for like part weight, total weight, connections, etc

## Sounds
* Add sounds and shit

## Toolgun Architecture 
* Make "do" action and its "inverse", so that you can not only undo
* Add "redo" after first one

## Toolgun Menu
* Expand menu with more GUI components (sliders, drop down options, etc)
* Make menu look better

## Custom Access Levels
* Allow op users to change server settings of VMod from toolgun menu.
* Make special commands for op users
    * Clean every mconstraint of acc level.
    * Set limit for total mconstraints of acc level.
    * Some other commands idk

## Server side things
* Add server side validation for (kinda âœ…) constraints and rendering

## Schematic
* Copy entities (maybe, idfk)
* Copy phys entities (not very important rn)
* Right now schematic logic assumes default mc world height. Make it not do that

## Rope Constraint
* Add ability to change rendering modes
* Add more setting options

## Hydraulics
* Make it more stable
* Fix the bug that crashes VS

## Elastic
A rope that can stretch or push (if option is chosen)

## Motor Constraint

## Pulley
A rope with connections to the ground through which it like moves. No idea on how to make it.

## Winch
A rope that can be made longer or shorter
Maybe have 2 ropes.
first rope will be "supporting rope" - it will have max compliance and force, but during retraction it will only shorten to diff between target and point
second rope will be "retracting rope" - it will have max force == needed force to counteract other forces + more, but idk how to calculate other forces

## Wheels
A tool that will create wheels from VS phys entities + maybe
