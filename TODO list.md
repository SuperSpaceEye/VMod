# VERY IMPORTANT

* Rename MConstraint to smth else. Maybe "VEntity" or "VmEntity" or smth like that cuz they are not really just a collection of constraints anymore
* Make "constraint fixer" to update old mconstraints

# Maybe

# Do Eventually

# Connection Mode
* when smth like "onMassChange" exists, create another mode for stiffness, damping, and bounce threshold that makes values depend on mass of the first ship or smth, so that instead of absolute values (like 3000 N of force) it's Nx ship mass (0.5 * 100kg)

# Phys rope
* fix incorrect loading

## Rendering
* Add clientside rendering options (like for Rope renderer allow setting maximum number of segments)
* Add clientside validation 
* Add effects for toolgun
* Group rendering objects by types to elevate common operations and add shared data between rendering types
* "Double rendering" so that if the "main" ship is out of rendering distance, it will still render correctly
* Fix rendering when i modify rendering transform of ships and player stands on the ship (VS2 moves camera when player stands on the ship) 
* Redo how normal renderers and block renderers work

## Constraint disabler
* A "wrapper" MConstraint that will "wrap" around MConstraint and enable/disable it when signal is given

## java.awt.Color doesn't exist in headless mode

## Toolgun settings presets menu
* maybe when pressing alt or smth it will show all presets for this mode, and allow player to cycle them

## Add a "wire" thing maybe as an addon to vmod

## General Code Structure
* Create "AutoGUIBuilder"

## Ticking Constraints
* Redo them

## HUD Rendering
* Add info window for like part weight, total weight, connections, etc

## Sounds
* Add sounds and shit

## Toolgun Architecture 
* Make "do" action and its "inverse", so that you can not only undo
* Add "redo" after first one

## Toolgun Menu
* Expand menu with more GUI components (sliders, drop down options, etc)
* Make menu look better

## Custom Access Levels
* Allow op users to change server settings of VMod from toolgun menu.
* Make special commands for op users
    * Clean every mconstraint of acc level.
    * Set limit for total mconstraints of acc level.
    * Some other commands idk

## Server side things
* Add server side validation for (kinda âœ…) constraints and rendering

## Schematic
* Copy entities (maybe, idfk)
* Copy phys entities (not very important rn)
* Right now schematic logic assumes default mc world height. Make it not do that

## Rope Constraint
* Add ability to change rendering modes
* Add more setting options

## Elastic
A rope that can stretch or push (if option is chosen)

## Motor Constraint

## Pulley
A rope with connections to the ground through which it like moves. No idea on how to make it.

## Winch
A rope that can be made longer or shorter
Maybe have 2 ropes.
first rope will be "supporting rope" - it will have max compliance and force, but during retraction it will only shorten to diff between target and point
second rope will be "retracting rope" - it will have max force == needed force to counteract other forces + more, but idk how to calculate other forces

## Wheels
A tool that will create wheels from VS phys entities + maybe
